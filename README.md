Astro Pi Challenge 2023 
Our experiment aims to study the changes of the Earth's magnetic field intensity along the ISS orbit and try to establish if it's affected by altitude and day or night time, by comparing the data with values obtained from the Worldwide World Magnetic Model (WMM). We also intend to investigate if the geomagnetic field was influenced by solar activity during the experiment and, if possible, detect the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), which is a region on Earthâ€™s surface where the intensity of the magnetic field is particularly low. We will compare our data with information from specialized research institutes that collect data about the radiation emitted by the Sun, like NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center.
